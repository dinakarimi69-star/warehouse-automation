Warehouse automation simulation with debugging and visualization (Python)
# Warehouse Automation & Debugging System (Python)

## 🎓 Academic Context
This project was developed as an applied Python simulation to demonstrate practical
skills relevant to the **Computer Vision & Data Science** master’s programme at
**NHL Stenden University of Applied Sciences**. The focus is on automation systems,
debugging methodologies, and data-driven performance analysis.

## 📦 Project Overview
The system simulates an automated warehouse environment in which multiple robots
are assigned item pick-up tasks across a grid-based warehouse. Each robot’s movement,
workload, and efficiency are monitored and analyzed to identify operational issues
such as inefficient routing, unbalanced task distribution, and idle resources.

Debugging insights are supported through **Matplotlib visualizations**, enabling
clear interpretation of system behavior and performance bottlenecks.
