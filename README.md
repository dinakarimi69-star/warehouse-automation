Warehouse automation simulation with debugging and visualization (Python)
# Warehouse Automation & Debugging System (Python)

## 🎓 Academic Context
This project was developed as an applied Python simulation to demonstrate practical
skills relevant to the **Computer Vision & Data Science** master’s programme at
**NHL Stenden University of Applied Sciences**. The focus is on automation systems,
debugging methodologies, and data-driven performance analysis.

## 📦 Project Overview
The system simulates an automated warehouse environment in which multiple robots
are assigned item pick-up tasks across a grid-based warehouse. Each robot’s movement,
workload, and efficiency are monitored and analyzed to identify operational issues
such as inefficient routing, unbalanced task distribution, and idle resources.

Debugging insights are supported through **Matplotlib visualizations**, enabling
clear interpretation of system behavior and performance bottlenecks.

## 🚀 Key Features
- Object-oriented simulation of warehouse robots
- Automated task allocation strategy
- Debugging logic for detecting inefficiencies
- Visual analysis of robot paths and workload distribution
- Modular and extensible Python design

## 🛠️ Technologies & Skills Demonstrated
- Python (OOP, clean architecture, modular design)
- Automation and system simulation
- Debugging and performance monitoring
- Data visualization with Matplotlib
- Analytical thinking and applied problem-solving

## 📊 Output & Debugging Insights
- Terminal-based debug reports (idle robots, excessive travel distance)
- Robot path visualization for spatial analysis
- Performance comparison charts for workload balancing

## 🎯 Relevance to NHL Stenden
This project reflects the **applied, practice-oriented learning approach** of NHL Stenden,
demonstrating how programming, data analysis, and visualization can be combined to
solve real-world automation challenges. The system is designed to be extendable toward
computer vision–based navigation, optimization algorithms, or real-time monitoring,
aligning with industry-focused data science applications.

## ▶️ How to Run
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
python warehouse_automation.py
